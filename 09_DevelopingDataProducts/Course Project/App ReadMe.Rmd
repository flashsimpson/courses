The Ticker App I created is a very simple way to get stock price information for a specific stock on a specific date (2007-Present)

after navigating to the app website (http://mikesimpson.shinyapps.io/CourseProject/)
simply enter the ticker symbol for a specific company, then either enter a date, or use the dropdown calender selector to find your desired date.  

A few nuances to the app include 
-you must select a date when the market was open (i.e no weekends or holidays)
-capitalization does not matter
-you many not just enter a company name it must be its ticker symbol (i.e. AAPL, YHOO, FDX etc.)
-the App just show the closing price on the specified date
